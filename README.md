# "Python Coding Journey: From Basics to Interactive Programs and Data Manipulation"



## Index

1. **Introduction to Python:**
   - Basic input/output and data types
   - Control structures: if, else, while, for

2. **Exploring Inbuilt Functions:**
   - Understanding and utilizing inbuilt functions
   - Demonstrations of `len()`, `input()`, `str()`, and more

3. **Data Manipulation Fundamentals:**
   - Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries
   - Indexing, slicing, modifying, and nesting
   - Examples: [Task 2: Create a list of length = 10 and access 5th to 8th data](#task-2)

4. **Interactive Programming:**
   - User input for mathematical operations
   - Loop-based interactive calculations
   - Examples: [Task 8: Ask 2 numbers from users and store it in num1 and num2](#task-8)

5. **Dictionary Mastery:**
   - Navigating nested dictionaries
   - Modifying keys and values, and adding entries
   - Examples: [Task 5: Dictionary operations](#task-5)

6. **Tuple Tricks:**
   - Workarounds for modifying tuples
   - Adding and removing elements creatively
   - Examples: [Task 6: Add and remove elements from a tuple](#task-6)

7. **Set Strategies:**
   - Using `difference()` and `symmetric_difference()` for set operations
   - Examples: [Task 7: difference() and symmetric_difference()](#task-7)

8. **Arithmetic Operator Selection:**
   - Building a user-friendly calculator with user preferences
   - Utilizing `while` loops, `if` conditions, and the `continue` statement
   - Examples: [Task 8: Ask 2 numbers from users and store it in num1 and num2](#task-8)

9. **Enhancing User Interaction:**
   - Extending calculator operations with user input checks
   - Introducing the `break` statement for controlled program termination
   - Examples: [Task 8: Ask 2 numbers from users and store it in num1 and num2](#task-8)

10. **Data Looping and Iteration:**
    - Printing numbers in reverse with `while` loops
    - Iterating through tuples, sets, and dictionaries
    - Examples: [Using Loop for set](#using-loop-for-set), [Using loop for dictionary](#using-loop-for-dictionary)

11. **Pythonic Techniques:**
    - Utilizing  `enumerate()` for compact code
    - Examples: [Task 10.4: Go through  enumerate()](#task-10.4)
    

12. **Your Turn:**
    - Encouragement to explore and experiment further
